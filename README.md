#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

-Software engineering is the process of planning, building, testing, and maintaining software. It helps make software reliable, easy to use, and free of errors. 
-Software engineering is important because it makes technology work smoothly in areas like banking, health, and communication.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

-Structured Programming (1960s–1970s) – Developers started using better ways to organize code, making software easier to read and update.
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s–1990s) – A new way of coding using "objects" to make software more reusable and organized.
-Agile Development (2000s–Now) – A flexible way of making software in small steps, allowing quick updates based on user feedback.


3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning – Decide what the software should do.
Analysis – Collect details about user needs.
Design – Plan how the software will look and work.
Implementation – Write the actual code.
Testing – Check for mistakes and fix them.
Deployment – Release the software for users.
Maintenance – Keep improving and fixing the software.


4.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Feature
Waterfall
Agile
Process
Step-by-step, one phase at a time
Flexible, works in small parts
Changes
Hard to change
Easy to adjust
Testing
Done at the end
Continuous throughout development
Best for 

Projects with fixed plans (e.g., hospital software)







Dynamic projects with evolving requirements (e.g., mobile apps)


Examples:
Waterfall: Developing a banking system where requirements are fixed.
Agile: Building an e-commerce website where user feedback drives changes


5.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Roles in a Software Engineering Team
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, ensures functionality, and collaborates with teams.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software, identifies bugs, and ensures high-quality standards.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, coordinates teams, and ensures objectives are met.


6.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
- Help developers write, debug, and manage code efficiently.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS): 
-Track code changes, enable collaboration, and prevent conflicts.
Examples: Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial.


7.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements → Use Agile methods to allow flexibility.
Bugs in Code → Test regularly and fix issues early.
Meeting Deadlines → Use tools like Jira and Trello to stay organized.


8.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Checks small parts of the code.
Integration Testing – Ensures different parts work together.
System Testing – Tests the entire software.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms that the software meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1.Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the skill of asking AI the right questions to get the best answers. It helps improve accuracy and efficiency in AI-based tasks.

2.Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Better Prompt
Bad Prompt: “Tell me about cars.”
Better Prompt: “Give a short history of electric cars, including key developments and major brands.”
Why is the Better Prompt Good?
Specific – Focuses only on electric cars.
Clear – Asks for history, key developments, and brands.
Concise – Avoids extra details.
